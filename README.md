Bridge Model Load Extraction Tool
The Bridge Model Load Extraction Tool currently interfaces with FEA program LARSA. 
The tool enables the user to directly interface with LARSA via its API. 

Currently the tool has been developed to firstly extract nominal force effects for specific bridge components and user defined force effects, the user shall define the Result Case, Geometry Group, Force Envelop, File and Sheet names to extract the component specific data and then interface this data with the BMLE Tool for production of load comibinations (to AASHTO) and interrogration of force effects.
